# My Favorite Applications for My Devices

## Applications

I use a lot of applications on a variety of devices, ranging from my Personal Android Phones, to my awesome Macbook Pro.

Here is a list of the ones I use the most in my daily day-to-day life:


### Multi-Platform

#### [Discord](https://discordapp.com)

- Discord is an amazingly powerful chat application that I use to keep in touch with certain niche communities (often gaming-related), as well as some friends.

#### [Atom](https://atom.io/)

- A powerful text editor that's highly customizable. Great for doing web dev work with a lot of cool features (and has a lot of extra bells and whistles). The downside is that it can have performance issues, and for that, I fall back on [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I occasionally use vi too, but I'm still learning that...

#### [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io)

- A SFTP client that also supports accessing Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud services. It's really convenient for SFTP file transfers, as well as the occasional transfer to other cloud services.

#### [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

- Anki is an app that uses a Spaced Repetition Algorithm in order for to have you constantly review material you deem that you are weak in. What makes this app great is that you don't need to keep track of what you're "good" or "bad" at. I use it from studying everything from Programming Topics, to real-world languages (currently brushing up on my Japanese Kanji).


### MacOS

#### [Better Touch Tool](https://www.boastr.net/)

- This is probably my only real "absolute must have" application I run on my Mac. It lets me set custom keyboard shortcuts, easily resize windows to my liking, has a clipboard manager, and so many other powerful features! It is a paid application, but the developer lets you set your own price. I'd say it's easily worth the money.

#### [IINA Video Player](https://github.com/lhc70000/iina)

- An absolutely gorgeous media player that is based on mpv, which means it can tackle most modern day video files with no problems. I recently discovered this as an alternative to VLC, and oh man, it's so much nicer to use. It has a lovely user experience, and is open source too!


### Android

#### [Reddit Sync Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync.pro&hl=en)

- My favorite Reddit client. It has an awesome UI, an excellent dark AMOLED theme, and all-in-all is a joy to use.

#### [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi)

- An open source manga-reading app that runs smoothly, and has a ton of great features

#### [7 Weeks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryan.brooks.sevenweeks.app&hl=en)

- A very easy to use goal-tracking app. Intuitive to use, and while it may not have all the features of other similar apps, it is straight to the point with no gimmicks or unnecessary details.

#### Google Play Music, Google Books, Inbox, other Google services

- Google has some excellent services. I'm a particular fan of Music, Books, and Inbox. I've used them for a very long time now, and while they each have their own hiccups, in general they've provided me with great cloud-enabled services.
- Google Music - stream my own personally uploaded music library (up to 50,000 songs!)
- Google Books - sync my own personally uploaded PDFs, etc, across many devices via the cloud
- Google Inbox - makes gmail management so much easier!
