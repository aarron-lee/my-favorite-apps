#My Favorite Applications for My Devices

##Applications

I use a lot of applications on a variety of devices, ranging from my Personal Android Phones, to my awesome Macbook Pro.

Here is a list of the ones I use the most in my daily day-to-day life:






### Multi-Platform

#### [Discord](https://discordapp.com)

- Discord is an amazingly powerful chat application that I use to keep in touch with certain niche communities (often gaming-related), as well as some friends.

#### [Atom](https://atom.io/)

- A powerful text editor that's highly customizable. Great for doing web dev work with a lot of cool features (and has a lot of extra bells and whistles). The downside is that it can have performance issues, and for that, I fall back on [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I occasionally use vi too, but I'm still learning that...

#### [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io)

- A SFTP client that also supports accessing Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud services. It's really convenient for SFTP file transfers, as well as the occasional transfer to other cloud services.


###MacOS

#### [Better Touch Tool](https://www.boastr.net/)

- This is probably my only real "absolute must have" application I run on my Mac. It lets me set custom keyboard shortcuts, easily resize windows to my liking, has a clipboard manager, and so many other powerful features! It is a paid application, but the developer lets you set your own price. I'd say it's easily worth the money.

#### [IINA Video Player](https://github.com/lhc70000/iina)

- An absolutely gorgeous media player that is based on mpv, which means it can tackle most modern day video files with no problems. I recently discovered this as an alternative to VLC, and oh man, it's so much nicer to use. It has a lovely user experience, and is open source too!
