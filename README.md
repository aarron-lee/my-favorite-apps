#My Favorite Applications for My Devices

##Applications

I use a lot of applications on a variety of devices, ranging from my Personal Android Phones, to my awesome Macbook Pro.

Here is a list of the ones I use the most in my daily day-to-day life:

###MacOS

#### [Better Touch Tool](https://www.boastr.net/)

- This is probably my only real "absolute must have" application I run on my Mac. It lets me set custom keyboard shortcuts, easily resize windows to my liking, has a clipboard manager, and so many other powerful features! It is a paid application, but the developer lets you set your own price. I'd say it's easily worth the money.

#### [IINA Video Player](https://github.com/lhc70000/iina)

- An absolutely gorgeous media player that is based on mpv, which means it can tackle most modern day video files with no problems. I recently discovered this as an alternative to VLC, and oh man, it's so much nicer to use. It has a lovely user experience, and is open source too!
